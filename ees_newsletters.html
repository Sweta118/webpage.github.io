              <p  style="font-size:3vh; text-align:left;" >Electrical Engineering Society is the oldest student society of the Institute
                
                of Engineering and Technology Lucknow, working under the Electrical Engineering 
                Department of the institute for enhancing the technical skills of the students.
        
                Since its inception, EES has benchmarked its efforts in providing a platform to 
                
                the students of the department for exposure into the field of electrical 
                engineering beyond the syllabus and curriculum, by arranging workshops, expert 
                lectures and industrial visits. Maintaining its legacy of knowledge transfer from
                 one year to another, EES bridges the gap of learning between the senior and junior students and provides a positive environment for mutual development with the help of various interaction sessions and by operating a departmental library.
                
        
                
                The core objectives and works of EES are in the direction to comply with the
                
                vision and mission of the Electrical Engineering Department and to bring out the 
                 best in the students of the department by arranging for necessary aids required
                  for their development.
                
                If we bounce back to the history of IET Lucknow at that time when no other 
                
                societies or clubs were functioning, EES organized all technical and cultural 
                events to evolve the students to the finest. And also 'Parakram' the annual technical
                 fest of IET was organized by this society.
                
                As due to resistors there is a voltage drop in the circuit, similarly due to 
                
                some reasons flotation of participating current stopped and this society became 
                inactive in some near past year. The day dawneth came, so was the scenario 
                with EES and came back into action. By the efforts of students of EE department,
                 a batch of 2016-20 the society was finally re-established on 22 Feb 2018 in the presence of Prof. Kuldeep Sahay, the honourable HOD of the Electrical Engineering Department, senior faculty members respected Prof. Bharti Dwivedi and Dr Satyendra Singh, Dr Pushkar Tripathi, Dr Arunima Verma and Faculty Adviser of EES, Dr Nitin Anand Srivastava.

                    This visit helped the students for a practical exposure in various subjects like control system, Power System.To build and run the metro, the Government of India and the Government of Uttar Pradesh formed the Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation, a 50:50 joint venture.
